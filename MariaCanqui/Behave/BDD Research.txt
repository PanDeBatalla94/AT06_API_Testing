- When and why BDD was defined
BDD was defined because programmers didn't know where or how start when they needed made a test. For this reason BDD was created, this define agile practices to develop a software. It was develop by Dan North.

- The most important aspects of BDD
Using BDD it's more easy validate the functionalities of the application.
Adaptation to changes.
Is a development process that permit a better communication beetween all the interested parts in a project
We use a language that all involved parts can understand

- Why is useful and when could be applied.
BDD is useful because is a methodology to develop software. 
In BDD the PO, QA team and developers are involucrated with the project. 

- Which type of teams could implement BDD
any team coul implement BDD

- Structure of a feature – Give an example
	Name: Register students grades
	Priority: High

- Structure of a user story – Give an example
	As a teacher
	I want to register grades of students enrolled in my 		parallels
		|IdStudent | IDSubject | IdParallel | Grade 1 | Grade 2 |
		|1         | 1         | 2          | 80      | 76      |

	So that the system calculate final grades

- Structure of a scenario – Give an example

	Scenario: Only grade 1
			Given that a teacher is register in the system 
			and is assigned to a course and a parallel
			When he go to the register grades section 
			he insert only grade 1 
			Then the system should ask for grade 2 			


- Differences between BDD and BDT
BDD is a methodology to develop based on TDD, BDT is a methodology to testing
BDD is present since the project starts unlike BDT that start in the middle of the project
